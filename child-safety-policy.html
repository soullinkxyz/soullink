    <h1>ClutterBang Child Safety Policy</h1>
    <p>
        ClutterBang strictly adheres to Google's Child Safety Standards to protect users and children from all threats, including Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</h2>
    <p>
        CSAE refers to any illegal activity involving sexual content, images, videos, or messages targeting minors. Our policies include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clearly prohibiting users under the age of 18 from registering or using the app.</li>
        <li>Providing in-app reporting tools for users to report any suspicious or harmful content immediately.</li>
        <li>Taking prompt action to report to Google, NCMEC, and local authorities (e.g., Korean National Police Cyber Bureau).</li>
        <li>Restricting accounts and launching internal investigations when violations occur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Reporting and Response</h2>
    <p>
        Users can report child safety concerns through the following channels:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In-app content reporting feature</li>
        <li>Email: <strong>soullink333@gmail.com</strong></li>
        <li>Direct reports: <a href="https://report.cyber.go.kr/">Korean Cyber Crime Report Center</a> or <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/">NCMEC CyberTipline</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All reports are reviewed by a designated contact and typically receive a response within 24 hours.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>
        ClutterBang complies with all applicable laws, including Korea’s Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse and the U.S. COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). We cooperate fully with legal authorities when required.
